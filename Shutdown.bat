@echo off
cmd /k shutdown -s -t 30 /c hahahahaha 


// keep in mind i have set the timer to 30 secconds (so there is enough time to open the cmd prompt and type "shutdown -a" to abort the shutdown incase they have some unsaved files. If you want it to be instant, change the timer frokm 30 secs to 1 sec)
